Forgot to add my analysis for each scatter plot so they are listed below:
This plot here shows that as you move from the equater to each pole, the avg temp will drop. 
This plot shows little correlation about the humidity changes vs latatude. If anything it looks like the northern cities have on avg more humidity though.
The cloudiness plot is interesting because many of the cities in the API call have either 0% or 100% humidity
The Wind speed plot indicates that, for the most part, windier cities are located away from the equator. I was reading an article explaining how the
earth rotates faster along the equator than at the poles which is why we see most weather move in curved patterns rather than straight lines
